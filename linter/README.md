# javascript Linter
I was made a function named readSimColon and it returns the number of lines that missing a semiColon

I was using a BufferedReader to read may file line by line and checking if the line is miss the semicolon or not by an if statment in addition to use the Exceptions .

#### The output will be like this:
Line 70: Missing semicolon.
Line 71: Missing semicolon.
Line 72: Missing semicolon.
Line 73: Missing semicolon.
Line 74: Missing semicolon.

#### And if the file clear from semiColons the result will be:
There is not any missing for semicolon in the file emptyFile.js
